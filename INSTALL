1. FreeBSD 4.x/5.x/6.x/7.x
On these systems module should work out-of-the-box, just type
# make
# make install

Note for 4.x - when using with sshdm you should turn "UsePrivilegeSeparation"
off, since FreeBSD 4.x's sshd version chnages process's uid before calling
setcred.

2. Linux
It will work with all modern Linux distributions (I have not tested it with
old distributions). You need PAM source to be installed. You will have to
instal gdbm & gdbm-compat library, as glibc has no DBM suport by default.

Use the same comands, as you will use for FreeBSD:
# make
# make install

3. SunOS
It can be surpising, but you will use the same commands to build module
on your SunOS box. Your $PATH should contain directory with C compiler
installed (/opt/SUNWspro/bin by default). Also it should contain
/usr/ucb directory before any other directories with "install" utility.

Now, just type:
# make
# make install
