.Nm pam_af
.Nd Anti brute-force protection PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_af
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module for PAM, typically
.Pa /usr/lib/pam_af.so ,
provides functionality for PAM authentification category. The main purpose of
.Nm
module is to prevent brute-force attacks against protected services, like
SSH. Although, it is desirable for users to enforce strong passwords, weak
password's practice are still very common. In these cases brute-force attack
can be succesful. Also these attacks can mess-up system log with useless
records, and system administrator can pass something important.
.Ss The authentification stage
The
.Nm
module maintains statistics for each host, that tries to authetificate. It
stores the number of attempts and last attempt's timestamp. In the
authetification stage the
.Nm
module finds the configuration rule for given host and makes appropiate
decision using failed attempt's count from host statistics. In case this
number exceeds specified limit, host would be rejected and blocked for time,
setted up in the host's rule. Additionally, external command can be executed
in that case. This can be used, for example, to block the 'bad' host in
firewall.
.Pp
Simillary, if the
.Nm
module detects the block time has been passed, it unlocks host and executes
given external command.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm debug
Report debugging information using
.Xr syslog 3
(at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level).
.It Cm no_warn
Suppress warning messages to the user. These messages include reasons why
the user's attempt was denied.
.It Cm allow_on_error
By default, the
.Nm
module would decline the user's authentification attempt, if unrecoverable
error occured. Specifing this option forces the PAM_SUCCESS will be returned
in this case.
.Im Cm update_locked
specify this option to force the
.Nm
module to update host's statistics even in case the host is locked. This can
increase module's overhead. This option can be useful if you wants the lock
time to be measured from last attempt.
.It Cm statdb=file
Use file as backing storage for statistics databse. By default
.Pa /var/db/pam_af.db
will be used. Attention : .db suffix will be added, so if you want,
for example, to use
.Pa /tmp/pam_af.db
as backing storage, you must specify statdb=/tmp/pam_af as
argument.
.It Cm cfgdb=file
Use file as backing storage for configuration databse. By default
.Pa /etc/pam_af.conf.db
will be used. Above notice also has place.

.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa /var/db/pam_af.db

.Sh BUGS
Host statistics is stored using hostname as hash key, so if the host has
several names, the statistics would not be accurate. Disable hostnames lookup
to avoid this.
